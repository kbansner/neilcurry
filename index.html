<p><b>The Well</b></p>

<p>Though he leant right out over the rim,<br />
The water was too far down for him to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time, you realise,&#8221; someone remarked<br />
Inside his head, &#8220;is only the rate</p>

<p>At which the past decays.&#8221;  And so,<br />
He let slip slowly through his fingers</p>

<p>The one or two choice memories he chanced<br />
To have about him, then stood listening</p>

<p>Attentively for their depleted echo.</p>

<p>Neil Curry</p>
